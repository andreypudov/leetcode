# 45. Jump Game II
#
# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are
# initially positioned at index 0.
#
# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from
# index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index
# (i + j) where:
#
#    - 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
#    - i + j < n
#
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are
# generated such that you can reach index n - 1.
